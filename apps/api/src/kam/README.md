# KAM Read-Only API

## 📌 Purpose
Expose read-only endpoints for Agent → Board → Frame → Config with scoped service-key auth, rate limits, and audit logging.

## 🧱 Key Files
- `routes.ts` – KAM router mounted at `/kam`
- `middleware.ts` – `kamAuth`, `kamScope`, `kamRateLimit`, `kamAudit`

## 🔄 Data & Behavior
- Read-only only; all routes require `Authorization: Bearer <SERVICE_KEY>` and `X-Domain-Id` headers.
- DTO responses (no Prisma internals).
- Rate limit: 100 req / 5 min per key.
- Audit: JSON line `[kam:audit]` per request.

## Routes
- `GET /kam/agents/:agentId/home` – Resolve Agent Home Board without mutation.
- `GET /kam/boards/:boardId` – Board metadata.
- `GET /kam/boards/:boardId/frames` – Ordered frames.
- `GET /kam/frames/:frameInstanceId/config` – Config/props of a frame.
- `GET /kam/boards?agentId=` – List boards by agent.

## ⚠️ Notes & ToDo
- [ ] Persist audit to DB table `kam_audit` (future).
- [ ] Add automated tests.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Duplicate Login Handlers

**WARNING**: The login/register handlers in `auth.ts` are **NOT USED** in production!

The actual handlers being used are **inline in `apps/api/src/index.ts`** (lines 628-750+).

**Why this matters:**
- Changes to `auth.ts` login handler will NOT affect production
- Cookie setting MUST be done in the `index.ts` handler
- This caused a critical auth bug (2025-10-15) where cookies weren't being set

**TODO**: Consolidate to use a single source of truth for auth handlers.

## 📆 Update Log
- 2025-10-15 (CRITICAL BUG FIX): Discovered and fixed missing cookie setting in login handler. The inline handler in `index.ts` (line 628) was being used instead of `auth.ts`, and it wasn't setting cookies at all. Added cookie setting directly to the `index.ts` handler. This explains why authenticated requests returned 401 despite successful login - no session cookie was ever being set!
- 2025-10-15 (Critical Fix): Fixed `session.ts` - changed `sameSite` from `'lax'` to `'none'` to enable cross-subdomain cookies between `api.ke3p.com` and `www.ke3p.com`. The `sameSite: 'lax'` setting was preventing the browser from storing the cookie when set from the API subdomain.
- 2025-10-15: Fixed `auth.ts` response format - login endpoint now returns `{ success: true, data: { token, user } }` to match frontend expectation (was `{ ok: true, token, user }`). Logout endpoint also changed from `{ ok: true }` to `{ success: true }`.
- 2025-10-11: Updated `session.ts` - `authWeb` middleware now ignores Authorization headers from browser requests (detected via Origin header). Header auth only allowed for CLI/tools (no Origin) or when `X-Client: cli` header is present. Enforces cookie-only authentication for web browsers in production.
- 2025-09-06: Allow domainless agents on ID/list routes (no domain header required if agent.domainId is null).
- 2025-09-06: Updated `/kam/agents/:agentId/home` to support domain discovery (no X-Domain-Id required).
- 2025-09-06: Added `lib/kamKeyLoader.ts`, normalized env key loading (CSV + single),
  dev-only diagnostics on first request, and bearer parsing improvements.
- 2025-09-04: Initial read-only implementation.
